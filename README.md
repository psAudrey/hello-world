# hello-world
Version 1.2 

This is just my first ever app on GitHub. More to come in the future. (Please have patience in the meantime.) Obligatory tutorial project (for whatever scripting language). Using this to say 'hi' to users, and ask for basic details, just playing around with programming languages to learn more languages. 

I was not clear on GIT, nor how I wanted this to work: as different script languages going through 'Hello World" steps, or do I want it to be more like a greeting in different languages, thereby like a subscription app that could be a gateway to translating a website for a user. 

I feel the aformentioned one would show you how I know different scripting languages, but I am not here really to impress people with all that. (I am here to learn and practice.) The latter will be a lot more useful to a website, for user to be able to read it, and perhaps subscribe or even comment in their native tongue and have it read to others in theirs. I think it could use in part an active  GIT start, and then get support branches for different languages.
